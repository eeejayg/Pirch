This is a client project for a retail chain known as Fixtures Living.  While you will not be able to run the project (it requires a complex array of cloud services) it is an interesting project which we can examine over chat.  Some projects are too large to create a feasible single-page app:  this project is compelling in that it uses multiple server routes, each of which terminates in a single-page app with multiple routes.  That is, it is comprised of multiple single-page apps.

Another interesting feature is its use of Marionette as a controller for Backbone.
